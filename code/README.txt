1. please use the data set client.csv as our dataset. Because we delete the first row(the ID) and first column in our data.

2. The ANN and SVM are using the normalized data. We conducted the data prepocessing and normalization in R, and save the data into the file: normalized_data.
(The code is in data_prepocessingt.R)

3.The classifier for competition is the ANN, which is in the "new_ANN_CV.R" file.

4. all the classifier we used except the ANN and Random forest is in the code "summary of all the models.R" file. 

5. "RF.m" is the code for random forest model.
